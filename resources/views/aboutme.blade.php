                    <p class="content">
                        When I was in Junior High, I upgraded my Atari 2600 to an Atari 800XL (with built-in BASIC) and
                        bought "Creating Adventure Games On Your Computer". It seemed to take weeks to type the first game,
                        but I was hooked.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I earned my B.S. degree in Molecular and Cellular Biology, where I studied early databases and
                        protein sequencing, but quickly realized that I needed a Doctorate to do anything significant in
                        that field. So, I moved into teaching Biology and Chemistry for the local high school and piloted
                        a new Microsoft initiative called "Laptops for Learners". As these were the days of Netscape Navigator
                        and javascript wasn't even a thing. I went to writing an online grading application where students
                        could log into the school's website to see their grades in real-time (very state of the art for the time).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I moved to Silicon Valley, where I settled into a job with a couple of high-tech manufacturers. In
                        those jobs, I learned JAVA (version 1.2 at the time), PL/SQL, PERL, Bourne Shell. Although technology
                        evolved, corporations (at least my company) stuck with that stack for a very long time. Then javascript
                        was released and everything got fun and exciting. And, after that, Python was released and it was
                        like being back in front of the Atari 800XL again. I worked my way from developer, to project
                        manager, to senior project manager, etc., until I reached Senior Program Manager (which meant that
                        I could manage very large projects (>$1.5M)). But, like all things IT, there was a rise and a fall,
                        and the company moved the IT operations to Singapore. I elected to stay in the U.S. and accepted
                        the severance.

                        This is where it gets a little bumpy, so stay with me. I wanted to go back to school and through
                        a series of events that happened in the span of three days, I found myself in Law School. I was
                        encouraged to stay in and finish by those closest to me, but never really saw myself as a lawyer.
                        I even passed the bar and am a fully licensed attorney, but I don't have an interest in practicing.
                        So, switch to Insurance. My dad made millions in the 90's running his own agency, and I thought,
                        if he could do it, so could I! Wrong. He has the gift of sales, and I am socially awkward. Nevertheless,
                        I found myself thoroughly enjoying Insurance, so as my own insurance agency was stagnating, I brought
                        programming and insurance together to automate my agency end-to-end. This achievement got me in
                        front of a very respected agency owner, who gave me an offer I couldn't refuse.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am currently the Director of Technology for the LaBarre/Oksnee Insurance Agency and am working
                        to migrate their 26+ year agency from a completing manual agency to completely automated and digital.
                        I am only four months in, but we have made some significant steps in the right direction and we should
                        be extremely well off in about a year.

                        Which leaves this site. After years of resumes and projects, I realized that had stuff spread all
                        over the web. So, I am going to take this time to consolidate everything into this application (site)
                        and use this as a personal repository for anything and everything that touches my professional life.
